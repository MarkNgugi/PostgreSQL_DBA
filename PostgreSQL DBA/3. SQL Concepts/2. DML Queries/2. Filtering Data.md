The WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause is used to filter records from a specific table. This clause is used along with the SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to get the desired output.
Syntax

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example

Consider the following employees table:
id	name	department	position	salary
1	John	HR	Manager	5000
2	Jane	IT	Developer	4500
3	Mark	Marketing	Designer	4000

To select all records from the employees table where salary is greater than 4000:

SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 4000;

Comparison Operators

PostgreSQL supports various comparison operators with the WHERE clause:

    Equal to: =
    Not equal to: <> or !=
    Greater than: >
    Less than: <
    Greater than or equal to: >=
    Less than or equal to: <=

These operators can be used to filter data based on numerical, string, or date comparisons.
Combining Multiple Conditions

To filter data using multiple conditions, PostgreSQL provides the following logical operators:

    AND: This operator is used when you want both conditions to be true.
    OR: This operator is used when you want either condition to be true.

Syntax

    AND:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;

    OR:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2;

Example

Using the previous employees table, to select records where the department is ‘IT’ and the salary is greater than or equal to 4500:

SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary >= 4500;

And to select records where either the position is ‘Manager’ or the salary is less than or equal to 4000:

SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE position = 'Manager' OR salary <= 4000;
