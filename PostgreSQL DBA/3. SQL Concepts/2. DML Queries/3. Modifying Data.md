INSERT

The INSERT statement is used to add new rows to a table. The basic syntax for an INSERT statement is as follows:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

Here’s an example of inserting a new row into a users table:

INSERT INTO users (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30);

INSERT Multiple Rows

You can also insert multiple rows at once using the following syntax:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...),
       (value4, value5, value6, ...),
       ...;

For example, inserting multiple rows into the users table:

INSERT INTO users (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30),
       (2, 'Jane Doe', 28),
       (3, 'Alice', 24);

UPDATE

The UPDATE statement is used to modify the data within a table. The basic syntax for an UPDATE statement is as follows:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

For example, updating a user’s age in the users table:

UPDATE users
SET age = 31
WHERE id = 1;

Note: It’s essential to use the WHERE clause to specify which rows need to be updated; otherwise, all rows in the table will be updated with the given values.
DELETE

The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table. The basic syntax for a DELETE statement is as follows:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

For example, deleting a user from the users table:

DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;

Note: As with the UPDATE statement, always use the WHERE clause to specify which rows should be deleted; otherwise, all rows in the table will be removed.
