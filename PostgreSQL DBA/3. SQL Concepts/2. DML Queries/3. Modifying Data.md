# INSERT

### The INSERT statement is used to add new rows to a table. The basic syntax for an INSERT statement is as follows:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
### Here’s an example of inserting a new row into a users table:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Mark', 30);
```

- #### INSERT Multiple Rows

##### You can also insert multiple rows at once using the following syntax:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...),
       (value4, value5, value6, ...),
       ...;
```

### For example, inserting multiple rows into the users table:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Mark', 30),
       (2, 'Jane Mary', 28),
       (3, 'Alice Joan', 24);
```

# UPDATE

### The UPDATE statement is used to modify the data within a table. The basic syntax for an UPDATE statement is as follows:
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

#### For example, updating a user’s age in the users table:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET age = 31
WHERE id = 1;
```
## Note: It’s important to use the WHERE clause to specify which rows need to be updated; otherwise, all rows in the table will be updated with the given values.

# DELETE

### The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table. The basic syntax for a DELETE statement is as follows:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
- #### For example, deleting a user from the users table:
```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```
## Note: As with the UPDATE statement, always use the WHERE clause to specify which rows should be deleted; otherwise, all rows in the table will be removed.
