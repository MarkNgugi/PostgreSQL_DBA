SELECT

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. You can select specific columns or retrieve all columns, filter records, sort records, or even join multiple tables together. Below is the basic syntax of a SELECT statement:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Examples:

    Selecting all columns from a table:

SELECT * FROM employees;

    Selecting specific columns from a table:

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;

    Select records based on a condition:

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 40000;

    Order records in ascending or descending order:

SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary ASC;

INSERT

The INSERT statement is used to add new records to a table. You can specify the values for each column in the new record, or you can use a subquery to insert records from another table. Here is the basic syntax for an INSERT statement:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

Examples:

    Inserting a single record:

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 50000);

    Insert multiple records at once:

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 50000),
       ('Jane', 'Doe', 55000);

UPDATE

The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. You can set new values for individual columns or for all columns. Here is the basic syntax for an UPDATE statement:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Examples:

    Updating a single record:

UPDATE employees
SET salary = 60000
WHERE employee_id = 1;

    Updating multiple records:

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE salary < 50000;

DELETE

The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table. You can delete one record or multiple records based on a condition. Here is the basic syntax for a DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Examples:

    Deleting a single record:

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;

    Deleting multiple records:

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE salary < 40000;
