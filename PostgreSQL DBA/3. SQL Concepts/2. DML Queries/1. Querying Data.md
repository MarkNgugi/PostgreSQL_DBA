WHERE condition;
```

### Examples:

```

- #### Selecting specific columns from a table:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
```

- #### Select records based on a condition:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 40000;
```
- #### Order records in ascending or descending order:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary ASC;
```

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Mark', 50000);
```

```
