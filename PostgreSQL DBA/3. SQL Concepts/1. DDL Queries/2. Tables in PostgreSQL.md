## For Tables in PostgreSQL

### Tables are essential components of a database, and they store the data in rows and columns.

### 1. CREATE TABLE

#### To create a new table, we use the CREATE TABLE query in PostgreSQL. This command allows you to define the columns, their data types, and any constraints that should be applied to the table as shown below:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
  hire_date DATE NOT NULL,
  department_id INTEGER,
  salary NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```
### 2. ALTER TABLE

### You can use this query to add, modify, or drop columns, and to add, alter, or drop table constraints. Some common examples include:

- #### Add a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE;
```
- #### Renaming a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;
```
- #### Modify a column’s data type:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN salary TYPE NUMERIC(12, 2);
```
- #### Drop a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN email;
```
- #### Add a foreign key constraint:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department_id FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id);
```
### DROP TABLE

#### If you want to delete a table and all of its data permanently, use the DROP TABLE command. Be careful with this query, as it cannot be undone. Here’s an example:
```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```
#### You can also use the CASCADE option to drop any dependent objects that reference the table:
```sql
DROP TABLE employees CASCADE;
```
### TRUNCATE TABLE

#### In some cases, you might want to delete all the data in a table without actually deleting the table itself. 
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```
### COPY TABLE

#### To copy data to and from a table in PostgreSQL, you can use the COPY command. This is especially useful for importing or exporting large quantities of data. Here’s an example:

- ##### Copy data from a CSV file into a table:
```sql
COPY employees (id, first_name, last_name, birth_date, hire_date, department_id, salary)
FROM '/path/to/employees.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

- ##### Copy data from a table to a CSV file:
```sql
COPY employees (id, first_name, last_name, birth_date, hire_date, department_id, salary)
TO '/path/to/employees_export.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```
