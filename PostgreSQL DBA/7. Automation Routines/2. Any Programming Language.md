## You can use higher-level programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript (with Node.js) to automate tasks and manipulate data in your PostgreSQL databases. These languages have libraries and frameworks to connect and interact with PostgreSQL databases easily:

### - Python: psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy
### - Ruby: pg or ActiveRecord (for Ruby on Rails)
### - Java: JDBC or Hibernate
### - JavaScript: pg-promise or Sequelize (for Node.js)

## These languages and libraries provide a more feature-rich and expressive way to interact with your PostgreSQL databases

## Today's Tasks

#### 1. Try automating different tasks (try no permissions)
#### 2. Automate different tasks using cron tabs
#### 3. Make a simple automation script using any language (js,python...)
#### 4. Try to automate CRUD operations (SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE)
#### 5. Try running the scripts over SSH protocol (nmap)
