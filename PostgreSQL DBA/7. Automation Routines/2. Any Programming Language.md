You can use higher-level programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript (with Node.js) to automate tasks and manipulate data in your PostgreSQL databases. These languages have libraries and frameworks to connect and interact with PostgreSQL databases easily:

    Python: psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy
    Ruby: pg or ActiveRecord (for Ruby on Rails)
    Java: JDBC or Hibernate
    JavaScript: pg-promise or Sequelize (for Node.js)

These languages and libraries provide a more feature-rich and expressive way to interact with your PostgreSQL databases
