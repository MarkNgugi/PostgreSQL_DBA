Configuration Management Tools for PostgreSQL

Several tools are available to help you implement configuration management in your PostgreSQL environment, such as:

    Ansible: A widely used open-source configuration management tool, ideal for managing multiple servers and automating tasks like configuration, deployment, and repetitive tasks.

    Chef: A popular tool for managing IT infrastructure, wherein you can write “recipes” to automate tasks, from server deployment to application deployment and management.

    Puppet: Another well-known configuration management solution, which allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure and automates the process of getting there.

    pgbedrock: A PostgreSQL-specific tool that allows you to manage your database roles, memberships, schema ownership, and privileges in a declarative way, using simple YAML files.
