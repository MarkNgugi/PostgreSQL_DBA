## Anonymization

### Techniques for anonymizing data in PostgreSQL

#### - `Data Masking`: Replacing sensitive information with random characters or numbers to make it unrecognizable. For example, replacing a person’s name with random letters.

#### - `Generalization`: Aggregating data to a higher level of abstraction, such as converting exact ages to age groups or locations to regions. This will allow you to analyze the data at a higher level without compromising individual privacy.

#### - `Pseudonymization`: Replacing sensitive information with synthetic substitutes, while maintaining a mapping of the original data to the pseudonyms. This allows data to still be useful for analysis purposes but protects identifiable information.

#### - `Data Swapping`: Interchanging some sensitive data between records to create a level of ambiguity on the true data combination. For example, swapping salaries of some employees within a company.

#### - `Random Noise Addition`: Adding random noise to the data elements in a dataset, thus making it more difficult to identify individual records.

### Tools for anonymizing data in PostgreSQL

#### `pg_anonymize`: It’s a PostgreSQL extension that can be used to mask and anonymize data. It can generate fake data, mask existing data or shuffle data between rows.

#### `anon`: A PostgreSQL extension that offers built-in anonymization functions, like data masking, randomizing and anonymization with k-anonymity.

#### `Data Masker`: A commercial solution that offers tools to mask and pseudonymize sensitive data according to your specific requirements.
