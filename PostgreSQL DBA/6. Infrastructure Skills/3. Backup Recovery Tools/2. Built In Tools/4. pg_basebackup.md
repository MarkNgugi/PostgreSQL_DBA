## pg_basebackup

#### pg_basebackup is a command-line utility that is included with the PostgreSQL distribution. It creates a base backup of a running PostgreSQL database cluster. The backup includes all files necessary to recreate the database, such as the configuration files, tablespace files, and transaction logs.
```
pg_basebackup -D /path/to/backup/dir -Ft -Xs -P -U backupuser -h localhost -p 5432
```

### Key features of pg_basebackup

#### - Online backups: You can create a backup while the database is running and serving client requests.
#### - Incremental backups: pg_basebackup supports creating incremental backups, which only include the changes made since the last full or incremental backup.
#### - Backup compression: You can compress the backup on-the-fly, saving disk space and reducing the time required for backups and restores.
#### - Backup progress reporting: The -P (or --progress) option displays a progress bar and estimated time-to-completion.
#### - Flexible backup formats: The backup can be stored in a directory or as a tar archive.
#### - Streaming replication support: The -Xs (or --xlog-method=stream) option allows for automatic setup of streaming replication on the cloned standby server.
#### - Encryption support: You can create encrypted backups by using the -z (or --gzip) option, which compresses the backup files using gzip. This helps to protect sensitive data and minimize storage space usage.

### Creating a base backup using pg_basebackup

#### To create a base backup using pg_basebackup, youâ€™ll typically specify the output format, WAL method, and other optional flags. For example:
```
pg_basebackup -D /path/to/backup/dir -Ft -Xs -P -U backupuser -h localhost -p 5432
```

#### This command will create a tar-format backup (-Ft) with streaming WAL files (-Xs) in the specified directory, showing progress information (-P), and connecting as the specified user (-U backupuser) to the local database (-h localhost -p 5432).

### Restoring from a base backup

#### To restore a PostgreSQL database cluster from a base backup, you can follow these steps:

#### 1. Stop the PostgreSQL server, if it is running.
#### 2. Remove or rename the existing data directory (specified by the data_directory configuration setting).
#### 3. Extract the base backup files to the new data directory.
#### 4. If the backup was created with streaming replication support, edit the recovery.conf file in the data directory to set the appropriate parameters (such as the connection information for the primary server, and any restore_command settings).
#### 5. Start the PostgreSQL server.
