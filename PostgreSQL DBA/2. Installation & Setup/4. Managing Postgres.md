## Using systemd

### In this section, weâ€™ll discuss how to manage PostgreSQL using systemd, which is the default service manager for many modern Linux distributions (such as CentOS, Ubuntu, and Debian). systemd enables you to start, stop, and check the status of PostgreSQL, as well as enable/disable automatic startup at boot time.

1. ## Starting, Stopping, and Restarting PostgreSQL

### To start, stop, or restart PostgreSQL using systemd, you can use the systemctl command, as shown below:

#### To start the PostgreSQL service, run:
```
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```
#### To stop the PostgreSQL service, run:
```
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```
#### To restart the PostgreSQL service, run:
```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```


2. ## Checking PostgreSQL Service Status

#### To check the status of the PostgreSQL service, you can use the systemctl status command:
```
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
