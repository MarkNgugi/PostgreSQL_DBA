### psql is an interactive command-line utility that enables you to interact with a PostgreSQL database server. Using psql, you can perform various SQL operations on your database.

- #### To connect to a PostgreSQL database using psql, open your terminal (on Linux or macOS) or Command Prompt (on Windows), and run the following command:

```
psql -h localhost -U myuser mydb
```

- #### Replace `“localhost”` with the address of the PostgreSQL server, `“myuser”` with your PostgreSQL username, and `“mydb”` with the name of the database you want to connect to.

- #### You’ll be prompted to enter your password. Enter it, and you should see the psql prompt:

`mydb=>`

## Basic psql commands

### Here are some basic commands to help you interact with your PostgreSQL database using psql:

#### To execute an SQL query, simply type it at the prompt followed by a semicolon (;), and hit enter. For example:

```mydb=> SELECT * FROM mytable;```

#### To quit psql, type \q and hit enter:

```mydb=> \q```

#### To list all databases in your PostgreSQL server, use the \l command:

```mydb=> \l```

#### To switch to another database, use the \c command followed by the database name:

```mydb=> \c anotherdb```

#### To list all tables in the current database, use the \dt command:

```mydb=> \dt```

#### To get information about a specific table, use the \d command followed by the table name:

```mydb=> \d mytable```
